#ok... this is totally my fault and I still want to say something to make an effort showing Im not being disrespectful and do care about these homeworks.
#I underestimated the homework and didn't start until today. Total mistake. I couldnt get VSC to open the csv file despite putting in correct code, os and csv import. I know that it is also in the same directory as my main.py file.i took it for granted and assumed it's a simple process : as long as csv file in the same directory as .py , it would read. I was wrong.  And i did have os and csv imported. 
#so I'm submiting what i thought would work if i had the exist file/directory. I'm sorry.

# In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and #`Profit/Losses`. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

# * Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

 # * The total number of months included in the dataset

 # * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  # * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  # * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  # * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

# * As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

#   ```text
#  Financial Analysis
#  ----------------------------
#  Total Months: 86
#  Total: $38382578
#  Average  Change: $-2315.12
# Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
# Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
